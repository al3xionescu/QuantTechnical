P: Two decks of cards. One deck has 52 cards, the other has 104. You pick two cards separately from a same pack. If both of two
cards are red, you win. Which pack will you choose?

R: I would choose deck with 104 cards. The probability of drawing two reds from the deck with 104 cards is 52/104 * 51/103, while
the probability of drawing two reds from the other deck is 26/52 * 25/51. As 51/103 * 1/2 > 25/51 * 1/2, the probability is 
higher when drawing from the deck with 104 cards.
