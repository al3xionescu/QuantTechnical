P: A group of people wants to determine their average salary on the condition that no individual would be able to find out 
anyone else's salary. Can they accomplish this, and, if so, how?

R: Yes, it is possible. The first person thinks of a random number, say X. This person adds this number to her salary. The rest 
of the group simply adds their salary to the initial number. Then, the first person subtracts the random number X and divides
the total salary sum by the size of the group to obtain the average.
