P: You have two strings, and a lighter. If you light a string at one end, it burns for one hour. You have no way of measuring or cutting 
the strings. How would you measure 45 minutes?

R: Take one of the strings (string A). Light both ends of string A, and at the same time, light one end of the other string (string B).
When the burning points of string A meet â€“ this will signal 30 minutes of time. At this point, light the unlit end of string B. When the 
burning points of string B meet, 45 minutes will have elapsed.
