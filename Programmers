P: Anna is looking at Betty. Betty is looking at Chip. Chip is not a programmer, but Anna is a programmer. Is there enough information to 
know if a programmer is looking at a non-programmer?

R: Yes, there is enough information. Consider these 2 cases: if Betty is not a programmer, then Anna(programmer) is looking at Betty
(non-programmer); else, then Betty(programmer) is looking at Chip(non-programmer).
